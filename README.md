This repository contains scripts for sleep and cataplexy quantification analysis in combination with temperature data, as well as codes to analyse fiber photometry results in relation to sleep states episodes and transitions. 
The scripts generate plots and export Excel files of results.
Functions necessary to run the scripts properly are included in the Functions folder.
