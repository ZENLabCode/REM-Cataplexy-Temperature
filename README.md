# REM Cataplexy Temperature
This repository contains scripts for sleep and cataplexy quantification analysis in combination with temperature data, as well as codes to analyse fiber photometry results in relation to sleep states episodes and transitions. 
The scripts generate plots and export Excel files of results. Starting folder paths from where scripts can select the files to analyse are left empty (ex. searchPath = ['']) and need to be filled with the folder path of your use.
Functions necessary to run the scripts properly are included in the Functions folder. 
For questions or to cite these codes, contact: markus.schmidt@insel.ch
